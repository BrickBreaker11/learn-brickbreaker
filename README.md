learn-brickbreaker
==================

An educational tool to introduce students to basic programming concepts. 

This project was created as part of the Koding Hackathon 2014 (http://koding.com/Hackathon). It is a three step lesson plan during which students will have created an entire BrickBreaker game. 

Our first lesson will focus on getting familiar with the environment, the exposed API, and programming control flow logic of if-else. The second lesson will teach students the concept of looping, and the third will combine these concepts and help students create a finished game.
